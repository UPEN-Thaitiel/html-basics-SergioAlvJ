    <p>William Blake (28 November 1757 â€“ 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and <br>
        printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in<br>
        the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his "prophetic <br>
        works" were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in proportion to its<br>
        merits the least read body of poetry in the English language".<sup>[2]</sup> His visual artistry led 21st-<br>
        century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever<br>
        produced".<sup>[3]</sup> In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest <br>
        Britons.<sup>[4]</sup> While he lived in London his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham,<br>
        <sup>[5]</sup> he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced the<br> 
        imagination as "the body of God"<sup>[6]</sup> or "human existence itself".<sup>[7]</sup></p>
    <p>Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he is held<br>
        in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical<br>
        and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised<br>
        as part of the Romantic movement and as "Pre-Romantic".<sup>[8]</sup> In fact, he has been said to be<br>
        "a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism".<sup>[9]</sup> A committed Christian who <br>
        was hostile to the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion),<br>
        Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and American revolutions.<br>
        <sup>[10][11]</sup> Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he maintained an amiable<br>
        relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers such <br>
        as Emanuel Swedenborg.<sup>[12]</sup> Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake's work<br>
        makes him difficult to classify. The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti <br>
        characterised him as a "glorious luminary",<sup>[13]</sup> and "a man not forestalled by predecessors,
